Solar Geyser Controller with ESP32 using Temperature and Light LDR. 100k Ohm resistors used to reduce ADC voltage to below 1V, this lowers the amps through Thermistor so power ON/OFF multiplexer is not required.

The code owner didn't pay me for the work. So I am licensing my modification under open source licensing terms.
